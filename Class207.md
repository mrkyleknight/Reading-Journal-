# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables


## Domain Modeling

Explain why we need domain modeling.

*Its a communication tool that defines a vocabulary that can be used within both technical and business teams.*


## HTML Table Basics

Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
*Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users, tables produce tag soup and tables are not automatically responsive*

List and describe 3 different  elements used in an HTML <table>.

*< form >, < table >, and < article>*

## Introducing Constructors

What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

*A constructor is just a function called using the "new" keyword and using a constructor is more concise and more conventional * 

How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

*This function creates and returns a new object each time we call it. The object will have two members*

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
NOTE: This is a very common front end developer interview question

 *Prototype is a blueprint for an object. Children inherit traits and characteristics from their parents, objects can inherit properties and methods from their prototypes. Just as objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes in programming.*
