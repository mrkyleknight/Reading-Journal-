# Hash tables 

### WHY: Hash tables are like magic boxes that find your stuff super fast because they don't like waiting.

### WHAT: A hash table is like a huge coat check where each coat has a unique number, and there's a wizard at the door who instantly knows where every coat is.

### HOW: The wizard (hash function) whispers a spell on your coat's number, and poof! Your coat appears or disappears in the right spot on the rack.
