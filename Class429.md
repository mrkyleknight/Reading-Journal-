### What database engine is Room wrapped around? Do you think this is a good choice? Why or why not?

Room is wrapped around SQLite. I think this is a good choice because SQLite is lightweight and reliable

### Do Rooms have any similarities to JPA?

Yes, Rooms have similarities to JPA in that both provide a way to interact with a database using objects and classes instead of writing raw SQL queries.

### Describe a DAO in your own words

Data Access Object, is like a helper that lets you talk to a database in a way that feels more like regular programming, without complex database code.
