# Purely functional programming, from Wikipedia

### Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

Functional programming relies on immutable data structures, so the state cannot be changed directly, but new modified versions can be created.

### Define purely functional programming.

Purely functional programming is a paradigm that emphasizes immutability, avoiding side effects, and using functions as the primary computation unit.

### How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

Purely functional programs will focus more on immutability and higher-order functions, avoiding mutable variables.
