# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

*"An object in JavaScript is a way of storing information. It's like a container that can hold different pieces of data, like text or numbers, and you can give each piece a name so that you can find it later. For example, imagine you have a shopping list. You can create an object called "myList" and give each item on the list a name, like "apples" or "milk". Then you can store the quantity of each item in the object too, so you know how much to buy. You can also add or remove items from the object as needed. Objects in JavaScript are really useful for organizing and manipulating data in your code." Chat GPT https://chat.openai.com/*

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?

 *Transfering related data items with one single object.* 

3. How do objects differ from arrays?

*Arrays are used when we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Objects are used to represent a things in our code.*

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

*if a property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot, but you can use a bracket notation.*

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

*This refers to the current object that the code is being executed in and it allows you to write more flexible and reusable code.*

## Introduction To The DOM

1. What is the DOM?

*The data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.*

2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

 *DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, or SVG documents. DOM is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.*
