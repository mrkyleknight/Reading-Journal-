# Functional Programming


## Functional Programming Concepts

What is functional programming?

is a programming style that focuses on using functions to perform tasks and avoids changing data directly.

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

 a function that consistently gives the same output for the same input and doesn't cause any unintended changes.

What are the benefits of a pure function?

 they are predictable, easy to test, reusable, and can be executed concurrently without issues.


What is immutability?

 data that cannot be changed once it is created, promoting reliability and efficient change detection.

What is Referential transparency?
 a function's output can be replaced with its computed value without affecting the program's behavior

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

What is a module?

its a self-contained piece of code that encapsulates related functionality, variables, and data, allowing for modular and organized code structure.

What does the word ‘require’ do?

The word 'require' is used in Node.js to import or include external modules into a file, making their functionality accessible in the current file.

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

To bring another module into the file we are working in, we use the 'require' function followed by the module's path or name.

What do we have to do to make a module available?

To make a module available, it needs to be installed either globally or locally in the project using a package manager like npm
