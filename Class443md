# Intro to Serverless

### What makes an API RESTful?

An API is RESTful when it's like a polite waiter that follows certain rules to take your order and serve you exactly what you asked for on the web.

### What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

Using GraphQL is like ordering a custom pizza where you get to pick only the toppings you want, but it might take a little longer to prepare because it's so specific.

### Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.

Its like having an invisible chef in the cloud who cooks and serves your dishes without you having to worry about the kitchen.
