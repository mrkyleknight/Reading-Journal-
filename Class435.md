### Graph Basics Cheat Sheet

Graph Definitions
Graph: A set of vertices and edges connecting them.
Vertex (Node): A point in the graph.
Edge: A line connecting two vertices.
Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex.

Graph Types
Undirected Graph: Edges have no direction.
Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a specific direction.
Weighted Graph: Edges have weights assigned.
Complete Graph: Every vertex connects to every other vertex.
Connected Graph: All vertices are connected in some way.
Disconnected Graph: Not all vertices are connected.
Cyclic Graph: Contains at least one cycle.
Acyclic Graph: Contains no cycles.

Graph Representations
Adjacency Matrix: 2D array representing the connections between vertices.
Adjacency List: A list where each vertex contains a list of its neighbors.
Graph Traversal Methods
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Queue: A data structure used in BFS.
Level: BFS traverses level by level.
Visited Set: To keep track of visited vertices and avoid cycles.
Depth-First Search (DFS)
Stack/Recursion: Data structure/technique used in DFS.
Branch: DFS explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
