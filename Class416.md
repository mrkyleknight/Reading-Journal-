# Spring Security overview

## What does it mean to authenticate a user?

Authenticating a user means verifying their identity to confirm that they are who they claim to be, typically through credentials like passwords, biometrics, or two-factor authentication.

## What does it mean to authorize a user?

Authorizing a user means granting or denying them access to certain resources or actions based on their authenticated identity and the permissions assigned to that identity.

## What are the three possible outcomes of the AuthenticationManagerâ€™s authenticate() method?

 Success if the user's credentials are valid and they are authenticated. 
 
 Failure if the user's credentials are invalid
 
 Error if there is an unexpected issue or exception during the authentication process.
