When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

*The first argument is a string. The second argument is your event listener function or object.*

Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

*the system produces or makes a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides the mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken*

*Kinda like a start or fire button.*

What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

*Event bubbling describes how the browser handles events targeted at nested elements.*
