## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

What is a ‘call’?

*the invocation of a function or a method in a program.*

How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

*That depends on the concurrency model of the programming language or the environment in which the program is running.*

What does LIFO mean?

*Last-In, First-Out*

What causes a Stack Overflow?

*a data structure that keeps track of function calls, exceeds its maximum capacity.*

## JavaScript error messages

What is a ‘reference error’?

*occurs when a variable or function is referenced that hasn't been declared or is not in scope.*

What is a ‘syntax error’?

*when the code violates the rules of the programming language's syntax and cannot be parsed or interpreted correctly.*

What is a ‘range error’?

*when a value is not within the acceptable range of values for a specific operation or data type.*

What is a ‘type error’?

*when an operation is performed on a value of an inappropriate type or when incompatible types are used together.*

What is a breakpoint?

*a specific point in the code where program execution can be paused for debugging purposes.*

What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

*it will pause the execution of code at a specific point and allow developers to inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the program's behavior.*
