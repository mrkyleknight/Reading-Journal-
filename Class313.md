*The REST methods that usually require an ID parameter are GET (when retrieving a specific resource), PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.*


Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?

*The relationship between REST and CRUD is that both are concepts used for managing resources.*

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be


1. Identify the resources in your application.
2. Define the endpoints, or the URLs, for those resources.
3. Determine the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for these endpoints.
4. Develop the functions to perform CRUD operations associated with these endpoints.
5. Implement proper HTTP responses for successful operations as well as errors.
