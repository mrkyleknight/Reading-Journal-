## Java OO Tutorial (only the Object and Class ones)

Explain the difference between an object and a class?

*A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects, whereas an object is an instance of a class that represents a specific entity in memory.*

Name two types of state that a Student object might have?

*name and age*

Name two types of behaviours that a student object might have?

*study() and attendClass()*

## Java Classes (do NOT do the Nested Classes section)

Explain the significance of a constructor for a class?

*A constructor for a class allows you to initialize objects and perform necessary setup operations.*


Write the declaration statement for a class named “Student” (do not fill it with fields and methods).

public class Student {

}

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers


What is the value of the binary number 1101?

*The binary number 1101 is equivalent to the decimal value 13.*

Write the number 52 in binary. Write it in hexidecimal.

binary is 110100

number 52 is represented as 34
