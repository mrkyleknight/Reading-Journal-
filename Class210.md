# Debugging


## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error?

*Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through.*

*Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.*

List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.? 

*Spelling errors, corrected by spelling the function correctly. Alot of Syntax Errors. Missing brackets etc.*

How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

*I think I have become better at finding and preventing errors.*


## The JavaScript Debugger.

How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

*The JavaScript debugger allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints*

Define what a breakpoint is?

*A breakpoint is a point in the program where the code will stop executing.*

What is the call stack?

*The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.*
