## Java OO Tutorial 

What is the difference between an Object and a Class in Java?

*A class is a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects, whereas an object is an instance of a class*

Explain to a non-technical friend the concept of inheritance in Java?

*Inheritance enables child classes to inherit and extend from a parent class, facilitating code reuse and representing object relationships*

## Java Static Keyword

Static methods are also called what? Why?

*Static methods are also called class-level methods because they belong to the class itself rather than to individual objects*

How can you access a variable of a class without instantiating an object from that class?

*By declaring the variable as static, you can access it directly using the class name followed by the variable name.*


## Java Singleton Class

What is a Design Pattern? Describe one or two with analogies from your previous work experience?

*Design patterns are established solutions to common software design problems, such as using the Factory pattern to create various reports based on user preferences or implementing the Observer pattern for a notification system with subscribers receiving updates.*

What is a Singleton?

*A Singleton is a design pattern that ensures only one instance of a class is created and provides global access to that instance.*
